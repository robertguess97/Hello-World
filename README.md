# Hello-World!
Still learning how to use github but this is my Quick flicks movie project.
The layout is finished. I am on route to finish to interactive side using javascript &amp; JQuery.
But the concept of the website is find local movies to rent or buy from individual with no charge from the site.
The goal is to make it a digital real estate and eventually earn revenue for marketing services on the site.

At one point i did learn how to make html email template feel free to take a look.
