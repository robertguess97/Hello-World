# Hello-World!
Still learning how to use github but this is my Quick flicks movie project.
The layout is finished. I am on route to finishing the interactive side, using javascript & JQuery.
But the concept of the website is find local movies to rent or buy from individual's with no charge from the site.
The goal is to make it a digital real estate and eventually earn revenue for marketing services on the site.

Also at one point i did learn how to make html email template feel free to take a look.
